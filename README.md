## Project Overview

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects Repository**. This Repository contains various projects demonstrating core concepts and theories in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and eventually **computer vision**. 
It will eventually include both **deployed applications**  and **GUI-based apps** for select projects. The projects  demonstrate the potential of machine learning across various domains, including medical diagnosis, 
human activity recognition, image processing, and more.

## Project List
**Certain projects were university collaborative work and are not actively maintained or structure compliant**
Here’s a detailed list of all projects included in this repository:
