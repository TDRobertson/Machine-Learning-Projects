## AI Agent (Gemini-based LLM Agent)

**Purpose**: This project is a simple AI Agent inspired by the Boot.dev curriculum. It acts as an LLM agent using Google's Gemini as the underlying pre-trained model via the `google-genai` SDK.

### What it does
- CLI that accepts a user prompt and returns a response generated by Gemini.
- Optional `--verbose` flag prints your prompt and token usage.

### AI Agent quick start

1. Requirements: Python 3.12+
2. Configure environment:
   - Create a `.env` file with `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`.
   - You can place `.env` at the repo root or inside `ai-agent/`.
3. Run (choose one):
   - With uv (recommended):
     ```bash
     cd ai-agent
     uv sync
     uv run python main.py "Write a short haiku about code" --verbose
     ```
   - With Python directly from repo root:
     ```bash
     python ai-agent/main.py "Write a short haiku about code" --verbose
     ```

### AI Agent configuration

- `ai-agent/config.py`:
  - `WORKING_DIR`: default `./calculator` (sandboxed working directory for tool calls)
  - `MAX_ITERS`: maximum tool-call/response iterations per prompt
  - `MAX_CHARS`: read limit when fetching file contents

### AI Agent utilities (tool functions)

- `get_files_info(directory=.)`: lists files with sizes and whether they are directories; constrained to `WORKING_DIR`.
- `get_file_content(file_path)`: reads up to `MAX_CHARS` characters from a file inside `WORKING_DIR`.
- `run_python_file(file_path, args=None)`: executes a Python file within `WORKING_DIR` using a 30s timeout; returns formatted output:
  - `STDOUT:` and `STDERR:` sections
  - Appends `Process exited with code X` on nonâ€‘zero exit
  - Returns `No output produced.` if both streams are empty and exit code is zero
- `write_file(file_path, content)`: writes/overwrites files under `WORKING_DIR` (creates parent dirs as needed).

### AI Agent limitations

- **Tool call limits**: Gemini has a limit of 100 tool calls per request.
- **File system access**: Only reads from `WORKING_DIR` and its subdirectories.
- **Python execution**: Runs Python files with a 30s timeout.
- **File size limits**: Reads up to `MAX_CHARS` characters from files.
