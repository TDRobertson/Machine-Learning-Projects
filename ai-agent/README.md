## AI Agent (Gemini-based LLM Agent)

**Purpose**: This project is a simple AI Agent inspired by the Boot.dev curriculum. It acts as an LLM agent using Google's Gemini as the underlying pre-trained model via the `google-genai` SDK.

### What it does
- Accepts a user prompt from the command line and returns a response generated by Gemini.
- Optional `--verbose` flag prints prompt and token usage.

### Quick start
1. Requirements: Python 3.12+
2. Install deps (choose one):
   - With uv: `uv sync` then `uv run python ai-agent/main.py "Hello, world!" --verbose`
3. Create a `.env` file at repo root with `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`.
4. Run:
   ```bash
   python ai-agent/main.py "Write a short haiku about code" --verbose
   ```

### Notes
- Uses: `google-genai`, `python-dotenv`.
- Model: `gemini-2.0-flash-001`.
- The `calculator/` subfolder contains a small CLI calculator demo and unit tests unrelated to the LLM agent.
